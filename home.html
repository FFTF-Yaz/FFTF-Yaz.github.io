        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is Yazdon Azhdari. </p>
        <p>For a brief period I studied computer science at Langara College but thought to complete my education at BCIT after some time instead.<br>
           During my free time, I find myself playing video games to relax.
           I have an interest in music, cooking, and gardening. <br>
           As one can tell, I take my work very seriously, but take every oppurtunity to have fun with it. </p>
